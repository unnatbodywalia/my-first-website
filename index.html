    <p>
        I am a 20-year-old student pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Business Systems at VIT Vellore. Along with my academic pursuits, I am passionate about fitness and love spending time at the gym to stay active and healthy. Currently, I live in Gurugram, a bustling city known for its vibrant atmosphere and proximity to Delhi. My interests extend beyond just academics, as I enjoy exploring new technologies, learning about business systems, and developing my skills to make an impact in the tech industry.
